# Stellarica

This project (A gradle nightmare) contains:

- A Paper plugin that aims to add various science fiction mechanics to
  Minecraft.
- A QOL Fabric mod to pair with said plugin.

Overall it's a ~~somewhat~~ very cursed mess of WIP code.

Originally a fork of Astralchroma's Minecraft Starship Plugin.

Uses some code from [Horizon's End](https://github.com/horizonsendmc/)'s OldIon codebase, as well as some code
from [AP Dev Team's Movecraft](https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft/) both licensed under GPL-3.
