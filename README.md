## Project Status
I (trainb0y) used this project a way to learn Kotlin, and over the year and a half of off-and-on development learned a lot. However, I also made a bunch of questionable design decisions that would require some pretty major refactoring, that at this point I don't really want to do. I kind of lost interest in Minecraft, and have moved on to other things. I still make occasional commits to keep this up to date with recent Minecraft versions, but the current plugin isn't that usable. It's here, and public, if anyone is curious or wants to build off of it (though I wouldn't recommend it) but I don't plan to continue it.

## About

This project (A gradle nightmare) contains:

- A Paper plugin that aims to add various science fiction mechanics to
  Minecraft.
- A QOL Fabric mod to pair with said plugin.
- Extremely cursed networking abstractions for communicating between them

Overall it's a ~~somewhat~~ very cursed mess of WIP code.

Originally a fork of Astralchroma's Minecraft Starship Plugin, but this now actually does stuff:tm:

Uses some code (bukkit scheduler wrapper) from [Horizon's End](https://github.com/horizonsendmc/)'s OldIon codebase,
though it has been mostly rewritten.
