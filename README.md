# Stellarica

This project (A gradle nightmare) contains:

- A Paper plugin that aims to add various science fiction mechanics to
  Minecraft.
- A QOL Fabric mod to pair with said plugin.
- Extremely cursed networking abstractions for communicating between them

Overall it's a ~~somewhat~~ very cursed mess of WIP code.

Originally a fork of Astralchroma's Minecraft Starship Plugin, but this now actually does stuff:tm:

Uses some code (bukkit scheduler wrapper) from [Horizon's End](https://github.com/horizonsendmc/)'s OldIon codebase,
though it has been mostly rewritten.
